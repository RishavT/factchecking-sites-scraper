# ðŸ‘‹ Say Hi

Small changes in a fact-checking website structure can cause the scraper to break. At any given time, there can be multiple issues with the scraper that are listed on [Github Issues](https://github.com/tattle-made/tattle-research/issues). You can also create a new GitHub issue if you spot a bug.
Reach out to the team with the issue(s) you want to tackle.

# ðŸ”¨ Do your thing

* Fork the Github Repo. 
* If you don't have an S3 account you can write to, replace lines uploading error files to s3 in live_scraping.py with a local destination. You could also comment them out if you are not interested in the error logs.

# ðŸ“ž Merge with Master

All code changes happen via pull request. We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). The easiest way to let us know if you want to combine your changes into the core code is to make a Pull Request (PR)
In your PR, please mention the following :
  * What does this PR do?
  * How do we test this PR?

We don't strictly follow test driven development (TDD) but any contributions that include tests are greatly appreciated.

Add/amend a readme file describing the changes you've made. 

# ðŸŽ‰ Celebrate
